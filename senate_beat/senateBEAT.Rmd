### Welcome to SenateBEAT


Welcome to Senate BEAT (Bill Exploratory Analysis and Tracking)! This tool allows the public to explore what is going on in the Senate. We have data from the 113th, 114th, and the current, 115th legislative sessions. 

Plese watch the video to learn some background about the project, and familiarize yourself with the site's tools. While we encourage you to explore the site yourself, we have also highlighted a couple findings we found particularly interesting on this page. Use the arrows to click through the storyboard, and learn some interesting findings! Then, continue exploring the other pages to learn more.

### What is the Senate working on?

![](./data/wordcloud.png){ width=103% }
```{r}
subject <- nodes %>%
  select(bioguideId, party,state, in_113, in_114, in_115) %>%
  left_join(read_csv("./data/member_leg_subject_matrix.csv"))

word_matrix <- subject
freq <- as.data.frame(colSums(word_matrix[7:1020]))
word <- row.names(freq)
word_matrix <- cbind(word,freq)
rownames(word_matrix) <- NULL

```
```{r, eval = FALSE}

Here are the subjects being discussed inside of over eight thousands bills by decsending frequency order. Ironically, "congressional oversight" is the most frequent subject.

This map allows a quick look at the legislative activity of each state overall, or relating to a specific policy area. Here, we are looking at the number of bills submitted by each state in the area of public lands and natural resources. 

Note the sharp divide between the Western United States and the rest of the nation. The federal government manages and maintains more than [300 million acres](http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/this-land-is-whose-land.aspx) of public lands in the West, somewhat contentiously. There is a constant tug-of-war between the federal government, states, and private entities over the use of public lands. One can compare this view with a [map of all federal lands and reservations](https://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/printable/images/pdf/fedlands/fedlands3.pdf) and find considerable similarities.
  
The standout here, Alaska, has vast public lands and is particularly rich in natural resources; as such, there is a unique interest in these issues. Alaska's senior Senator, Lisa Murkowski, is also the chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

### Understand the legislative priorities of each state

```{r}
national_totals <- mapdata3 %>% 
  group_by(policy_area, session) %>% 
  summarise(national_total = sum(total_submit)) %>% 
  ungroup()
  
data_tab3 <- mapdata3 %>%
    left_join(national_totals) %>%
    filter(grepl("New Mexico", state_name))

tm <- treemap(data_tab3, "policy_area",
              vSize = "total_submit", vColor = "national_total",
              type = "value", palette = rev(viridis(6)))

hctreemap(tm) %>%
  hc_add_theme(thm) %>%
  hc_title(text = "Bills submitted by New Mexico's Senators") %>%
  hc_legend(align = "center", enabled = TRUE)
```

We hear a lot about fights in the Senate over healthcare, taxation, and other big landmark legislation. But there is a lot more that your Senators are interested in, and much of it reflects concerns more regional or local than national. 

Here we see the distribution of bills by policy area submitted by New Mexico's Senators over the last few years. The area of each rectangle is proportional to the number of bills introduced by New Mexico's Senators in that policy area, and the color scale is proportional to the national totals (darker is more).

While there are a fair number of bills introduced which deal with areas which concern us all, like national security and taxation, we see that New Mexico's representatives are putting a lot of effort into issues which are specific to their constituents. Comprising a large proportion of the total bills introduced are those relating to natural resources, energy, and the environment. New Mexico is [rich in natural resources](https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=NM), including crude oil and some natural gas, but is also a leader in renewable sources like solar and wind power. Their large Native American population ([2nd highest proportion in the nation](https://www.census.gov/population/estimates/state/rank/aiea.txt)) is also reflected in the policy areas pursued by their Senators.

### What is your Senator up to? 

```{r}
senatorstats <- senatordata %>% 
    filter(grepl("114", session)) %>% 
    group_by(state, senator) %>% 
    filter(grepl("Louisiana", state_name))

senatorstats %>%
summarise(sum(n()), 
         sum(billoutcome == "Became Law"), 
         Percent = round(mean(billoutcome == "Became Law")*100, 2)) %>%
`colnames<-`(c("State", "Senator", "Bills Introduced", "Number Passed as Law", "% Passed as Law")) %>% knitr::kable()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
network <- senatordata %>% 
    filter(grepl("114", as.character(session))) 

network_focus <- network %>% 
    group_by(state, senator) %>% 
    filter(grepl("Louisiana", state_name))

sen_ID <- network_focus$bioguideId

senator_edges <- simp_edges %>% 
  filter((from == sen_ID | to == sen_ID)) 

senator_edges <- senator_edges[order(senator_edges$weight,decreasing = TRUE)[1:20],]
# Then subset nodes
nodes_subset <- nodes %>%
  filter((bioguideId %in% senator_edges$to | bioguideId %in% senator_edges$from))

# Set target and source as indices to node data
# minus 1 because it converts to JS which uses 0-indexing
senator_edges <- senator_edges %>%
  mutate(source = match(from, nodes_subset$bioguideId) - 1,
         target = match(to, nodes_subset$bioguideId) - 1)
        
forceNetwork(Links = senator_edges, Nodes = nodes_subset,

     # -- Nodes and labels
     fontSize = 18,

     opacity = 0.6,
     opacityNoHover = 0.5,
     # -- Edges
     arrows = TRUE,
     linkColour = c("grey", "grey"),
     # -- Layout
     linkDistance = 200,
     charge = -40,

During the 114th Legislative Session, the Senators from Louisiana sponsored more bills than any other state. Yet, looking more closely at the table, we can see that while David Vitter sponsored 125 bills and Bill Cassidy sponsored 39, almost none of the bills they sponsored passed. 

Additionally, David Vitter (R) has a very connected network. This joint network display shows you the connections for senators in the state you select. Here, David Vitter has many connections, and even crosses party lines. The arrows pointing towards David's circle indicates senators that have cosponored a bill David has sponsored. The arrows pointing away from David indicate bills he has supported for other senators. However, if you look at Bill Cassidy, he is only connected to David, and has no cosponsored anyone else's bills, nor has anyone (other than David) sponsored his. 

If you continue your exploration, take a look at the Louisiana during the 113th session. Louisiana sponsored the second most bills during the 113th, and yet this time, none of them passed. If I were a constituent from LA, I would be concerned about these numbers. Are LA senators wasting time on bills with no merit? Are they sponsoring bills just to report activity? Check out [this page](#senator-activity) and explore the senator activity from your home state. Are your senators getting bills pased? Do they work closely with members from other parties, or do they generally stick to their own party? Are they influencing activity, or do they follow the lead of others? 

### See what your Senator's legislative passions are, and explore who has similar interests

```{r}
# Matrix filtering
filtered <- subject_matrix %>%
  filter(in_115 == 1)
mat <- filtered %>% 
  select(-bioguideId, -label, -party, -in_113, -in_114, -in_115)
rownames(mat) <- filtered$label
dists <- distances(mat)
# Output options
rows <- 20
columns <- 20
# Matrix sorting
matrix_senator <- "Brown, Sherrod (D-OH)"
sortby <- mat[matrix_senator, ]
mat <- mat[, order(sortby, decreasing = TRUE)]
mat <- mat[nearest_neighbor_search(dists, rows, which(rownames(mat) == matrix_senator)), ]

heatmaply(
  mat[1:20, 1:20],
  dendrogram = "none",
  label_names = c("Senator", "Subject", "Bills"),
  grid_gap = 0.3,
  hide_colorbar = TRUE
  )
```

***

This heatmap allows insight into your Senator's interests. What are the subjects he or she is passionate about? The columns represent [legislative subjects](https://www.congress.gov/browse/legislative-subject-terms/115th-congress), sorted by how many bills pertaining to that subject have been sponsored by the selected Senator. The rest of the Senators shown are sorted by the similarity of their interests.

Sherrod Brown, senior Senator from Ohio, clearly cares a lot about the health of his constituents and beyond -- eight of his top 20 most frequent legislative subjects are concerned with healthcare. He also appears to be passionate about Congress' role in regulation, governmental function, and oversight. 

If you are familiar with Sherrod Brown and his progressive platform, you might be surprised to see the his closest neighbors are all Republicans. This doesn't mean that he shares similar policy goals, but that they are interested in similar policy subjects. For example, Ed Markey (D-MA) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) both show a strong interest in legislation relating to oil and gas, but you can guess that they have very different aims. 

However, this view can highlight nuances that don't make it into the headlines about partisan politics. Sherrod Brown and John Thune (R-SD) may have more in common than you think when it comes to things like Medicare and healthcare access.

### Notes
#### Heatmap
- Columns sorted by number of bills sponsored featuring that subject
- Rows sorted by overall similarity of other Senators' legislative subject interests

#### Bipartisan Index
- Based on each Senators cosponsorship network 
- A higher value indicates stronger out-party cosponsor support (both given and received) 
- Independents are grouped with the party they caucus with
